What is love ? It 's a hard term to define in so far as it has a very wide application . I can love jogging . I can love a book , a movie . I can love escalopes . I can love my wife . ( Laughter ) But there 's a great difference between an escalope and my wife , for instance . Therefore , only another desiring conscience can conceive me as a desirable being . The individual used to find an answer to this problem by submitting his life to community rules . But a phenomenon started in the 13th century , mainly in the Renaissance , in the West , that caused the biggest identity crisis in the history of humankind . These three intertwined processes have completely annihilated all the traditional bearings of Western societies , with radical consequences for the individual . On the free market of individual desires , I negotiate my value every day . I call this act of collecting , along with others , seduction capital . In light of this observation on contemporary love , how can we think of love in the years to come ? We can envision two hypotheses : The first one consists of betting that this process of narcissistic capitalization will intensify . By the way , there 's a program on MTV already in which seduction teachers treat heartache as a disease . Of course , this race for seduction , like every fierce competition , will create huge disparities in narcissistic satisfaction , and therefore a lot of loneliness and frustration too . Another path to thinking about love may be possible . We are all useless . I think that becoming aware of this general imposture that concerns all of us would ease our love relationships . In contrast to this attitude , I call upon tenderness -- love as tenderness . I refer to self-mockery .
