Dan Holzman : Please throw out the beanbag chairs . Here we go . Barry Friedman : There are all kinds of high-tech chairs here today , but this is really , I think , when it reached its peak as far as ergonomics , comfort , design , flexibility ... DH : Now obviously , this is not something we do on our regular show ; it 's something we just kind of learned for this , so we 're going to try . But can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs ? BF : Nice show , Daniel , nice show . You are the man ! Nice show . Man , that was good ! DH : Thank you . BF : You know , sometimes when people do those , they go all the way down . You actually just did that . ( Laughter ) That 's the kind of extra effort that 's gotten us where we are today ... DH : All right , let 's show them something special . BF : ... without a MacArthur grant . BF : Last night , Michael Moschen showed some juggling props he has invented and working on . DH : A type of juggling I actually invented , right after I saw another juggler do it . BF : Shut up . DH : And this is a small excerpt from a longer piece . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Folks , this is shaker cup juggling . BF : Oh yeah , it does . ( Applause ) DH : One more ? ( Drum roll ) Perfect . ( Applause ) I 'm now pushing my luck : I 'm skipping right to six cups . BF : Also three with his left . DH : Perfect . ( Laughter ) And now , all six cups . BF : First try ? Once on purpose ? ( Audience : Once on purpose ! ) DH : How about if I try first and then decide ? BF : Good idea . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) DH : He 's looking at me . BF : That 's all right , he does that . DH : Oh ! It 's time for Richard 's help . BF : You know , over the years , every year at the conference , it 's kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous with Richard . DH : Excuse me , could we work on the design of the microphone ? BF : I think that 's the next session . DH : Next session ? BF : Yeah . DH : Please stand up , Richard . Oh , sorry . DH : Now Richard , please ... ( Whip cracks ) BF : OK , sorry . DH : Jesus Christ . Richard Wurman : Can I say something ? BF : Sure . RW : In all past years I 've rehearsed with them , the things that have happened to me -- I have no idea what 's going to happen and that 's the truth . DH : All right , please stand here in front ... God , I hate that . ( Laughter ) BF : No , come stay up with him . ( Laughter ) DH : Wow , you 've been working out . BF : No , shut up ! ( Laughter ) Having a little bit of Richard time . DH : Please hold my wrist , will you . There you go . ( Laughter ) OK . OK , hold on . RW : Hmmm . ( Laughter ) DH : First one . BF : All those mid-year phone calls are coming back to me now , Richard . ( Laughter ) DH : So Richard , what were we on the list ? Like 1,020 ? ( Laughter ) What happened there ? BF : I think we were just outside . DH : I do n't get it . ( Laughter ) DH : Sorry . RW : Do you want me to hold you or not ? DH : Do n't hold me that hard . BF : Here we go , I 'm taking it . DH : One more , one more . BF : We 've got one more we 're going to do . RW : Do I get to hold them ? BF : You do n't want to hold these , trust me . DH : Could you spread your legs a little bit ? ( Laughter ) BF : Gloria , you want to do it ? It 's very cool . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) One more try . ( Laughter ) Could you just push that ? ( Applause ) DH : Wow ! Boy ! BF : That 's cool . ( Laughter ) DH : Let 's jump this way , though . ( Laughter ) DH : Wow ! BF : Hoping for a little more build . DH : True . BF : I 'm going to run up behind him . DH : Leap over my shoulder . BF : Up and over his shoulders . DH : Grab the blades in mid-air , land right there in a pool of blood ... ( Laughter ) Still juggling . BF : Incredible , you say ? DH : Why bother , you say ? BF : Here we go . DH : Just do it juggler boys , you say ? BF : This guy , this guy invented air . BF : He invented the pencil . DH : All right , we 'll do this trick , but please remember it took us over 10 years to perfect . BF : Ten years to perfect , which you 're about to see . DH : It 's not that difficult , we just do n't like to practice that much . BF : No , it 's a hassle . DH : Will someone please throw a small farm animal up onto the stage ? ( Laughter ) Or a virgin for a sacrifice ? BF : Anything ? DH : Where 's Gloria ? ( Laughter ) BF : No , she 's got ... farm animal . DH : Do you have a small farm animal ? Just trying to play the odds . BF : Over the top , over the top . DH : How you feeling , Barry ? You feeling all right ? BF : Yeah , it 's all right . DH : Do you feel everything 's OK ? The atmosphere , the ... BF : Yeah , a little sketchy . DH : Everything up here 's OK ? BF : Yeah . DH : Then here we go . BF : This one 's a little ... Who 's doing the lights ? Could you point that a little more directly into my eyeballs ? Is that possible ? ( Laughter ) I can still see a little . DH : And turn up the intensity ; we 're still pink in the middle . BF : Yeah , it 's too far . DH : Ready , Barry ? BF : Over the top . DH : May we have our jumping music please ? ( Silence ) May we have it a bit louder ? ( Laughter ) BF : They 're a good crew ! Whoa ! DH : Whoa , sorry . BF : We 're going on . DH : All right , we 'll try again . BF : All right ? Oh my gosh . DH : All right , here we go . BF : I thought I had the hard part . DH : Whenever you 're ready . BF : There we go ! ( Applause ) All right , get up ! Come on and dance ! DH : Dance , come on . ( Applause ) Wow , wow , OK , stop . DH : The French judge ... BF : One more quick thing . DH : The French judge gives it a 5.2 . ( Laughter ) BF : Well , you know ... DH : There you go ... BF : Oh , yeah . DH : Tell them about our bio and stuff . BF : Yeah . DH : That 's right . BF : Good . DH : I know what you 're thinking : other juggling teams must really suck . ( Laughter ) BF : Juggling 's got a bad rap . DH : But wait , Barry , there 's still one more club lying there by my foot . BF : Shut up . DH : There 's still one more by my foot . BF : Richard you tell him , it 's your last year . DH : That 's a pretty good setup , Richard . BF : Yeah , it 's a good setup . DH : You ca n't get any better than that . BF : Nice . DH : I got that -- to reach down and grab that club in my grip of steel . BF : Nice . DH : I touched it , Barry . BF : It 's progress , that 's the thing . ( Laughter ) DH : How about that ? I 'll do it again . BF : It is , it 's weird . DH : Wow ! What a great trick , Barry ! Oh , look how it lies there . ( Laughter ) You are my hero . BF : From my foot , I 'll attempt to kick the seventh club . DH : Where , Barry ? Where ? Tell us , Barry . BF : All right ! You have to turn off the TV from time to time . DH : I do , I do . BF : From six to seven . BF : Yes . DH : Whenever you 're ready there , big guy . BF : Oh , oh , whoa . ( Applause ) DH : Please , please stay seated . BF : Seven-club juggling . DH : ... to back . BF : Thank you , that 's it . BF : Thank you guys ! DH : Thank you very much !
