I just came back from a community that holds the secret to human survival . It 's a place where women run the show , have sex to say hello , and play rules the day -- where fun is serious business . And no , this is n't Burning Man or San Francisco . ( Laughter ) Ladies and gentlemen , meet your cousins . ( Laughter ) But unfortunately , we have made too much of an emphasis of this aspect in our narratives of human evolution . The Congo is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself -- the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as the First World War . Who are these cousins ? We know them as the `` make love , not war '' apes since they have frequent , promiscuous and bisexual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues . Now , I do n't know how you play , but I want to show you a couple of unique clips fresh from the wild . But play 's a shapeshifter . So these are just small tasters into the insights that bonobo give us to our past and present . And so , my fellow primates , let us embrace this gift from evolution and play together , as we rediscover creativity , fellowship and wonder . Thank you . ( Applause )
