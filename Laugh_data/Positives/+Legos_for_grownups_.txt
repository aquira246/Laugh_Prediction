So , these are the Dark Ages . And the Dark Ages are the time between when you put away the Lego for the last time as a kid , and you decide as an adult that it is okay to play with a kid 's toy . Started out with my then four-year-old : `` Oh , should buy the kid some Lego . That stuff 's cool . '' Walked into the Lego store . Bought him this . It 's totally appropriate for a four-year-old . ( Laughter ) I think the box says -- let 's see here -- `` 8 to 12 '' on it . Pretty soon it got a little bit out of control . So then you realize there are these conventions . So then you really get into it , and you 're like , `` Well , the Lego people in Denmark , they 've got all this software to let you build your own virtually . Then you notice that if that Lego-provided CAD program is n't enough , there 's an entire open-source , third-party , independent Lego CAD program that lets you do 3D modeling and 3D rendering and make , in fact , movies out of Lego , 3D films of which there are thousands on YouTube , and some of them sort of mimicking famous films and some totally original content -- just beautiful -- and people recreating all sorts of things . ( Laughter ) There 's a whole programming language and robotics tool , so if you want to teach someone how to program , kid , adult , whatever it is . There 's people getting drunk building Lego , and you 've got to finish the thing before you puke . And then , just some examples . Anyway , I 'm out of time . ( Applause )
