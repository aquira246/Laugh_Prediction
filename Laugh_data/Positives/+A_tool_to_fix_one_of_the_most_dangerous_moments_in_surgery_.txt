The first time I stood in the operating room and watched a real surgery , I had no idea what to expect . I was a college student in engineering . I thought it was going to be like on TV . Ominous music playing in the background , beads of sweat pouring down the surgeon 's face . But it was n't like that at all . There was music playing on this day , I think it was Madonna 's greatest hits . ( Laughter ) And there was plenty of conversation , not just about the patient 's heart rate , but about sports and weekend plans . The first time I saw that I was watching a type of surgery called laparoscopic surgery And for those of you who are unfamiliar , laparoscopic surgery , instead of the large open incision you might be used to with surgery , a laparoscopic surgery is where the surgeon creates these three or more small incisions in the patient . So when I got to graduate school , this is what I wanted to work on . So let 's take a look at some of the devices that are used in these types of procedures . So what are those physics ? Let 's go back to drilling through a wall . So imagine you have a device and it 's got some kind of sharp tip to cut through tissue . But it did n't always look like this . So my favorite quote about laparoscopic surgery comes from a Doctor H. C. Jacobaeus : `` It is puncture itself that causes risk . So it 's easy to think that for every major problem out there there 's some team of experts working around the clock to solve it . ( Applause )
