When I was nine years old , my mom asked me what I would want my house to look like , and I drew this fairy mushroom . And then she actually built it . ( Laughter ) I do n't think I realized this was so unusual at the time , and maybe I still have n't , because I 'm still designing houses . Now , we do have all the necessary luxuries , like bathrooms . It 's actually a wild grass . That 's my dad . Now , we harvest from hundreds of family-owned clumps . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And when my father built Green School in Bali , he chose bamboo for all of the buildings on campus , because he saw it as a promise . So along with some of the original builders of Green School , I founded Ibuku . We 're also working on a little house for export . Now , what we 're doing , it 's not entirely new . And so we thought , what will it take to change their minds , to convince people that bamboo is worth building with , much less worth aspiring to ? First , we needed safe treatment solutions . Second , build something extraordinary out of it . So we design in real 3D , making scale structural models out of the same material that we 'll later use to build the house . So that 's the blueprint of the house . ( Laughter ) And we bring it to site , and with tiny rulers , we measure each pole , and consider each curve , and we choose a piece of bamboo from the pile to replicate that house on site . When it comes down to the details , we consider everything . To reap the selective benefits and work within the constraints of this material , we have really had to push ourselves , and within that constraint , we have found space for something new . And the floor that you walk on , can it affect the way that you walk ? Can it change the footprint that you 'll ultimately leave on the world ? I remember being nine years old and feeling wonder , and possibility , and a little bit of idealism . Thank you . ( Applause )
