I love to collect things . Ever since I was a kid , I 've had massive collections of random stuff , everything from bizarre hot sauces from all around the world to insects that I 've captured and put in jars . Now , it 's no secret , because I like collecting things , that I love the Natural History Museum and the collections of animals at the Natural History Museum in dioramas . These , to me , are like living sculptures , right , that you can go and look at , and they memorialize a specific point of time in this animal 's life . So I was thinking about my own life , and how I 'd like to memorialize my life , you know , for the ages , and also — ( Laughter ) — the lives of my friends , but the problem with this is that my friends are n't quite keen on the idea of me taxidermy-ing them . So instead , I turned to video , and video is the next best way to preserve and memorialize someone and to capture a specific moment in time . So , this is interesting to me , but it lacked a certain human element . So this was really interesting to me , this idea of taking video off the screen and putting it in real life , and also adding interactivity to sculpture . But something about the first piece , the Animali Chordata piece , kept coming back to me , this idea of interaction with art , and I really liked the idea of people being able to interact , and also being challenged by interacting with art . But , but this seems a bit unfair , right ? I put my friends in jars , I put this character , this sort of endangered species character in a blender . So I like this about interactive video sculpture , that you can actually interact with it , that all of you can actually touch an artwork and be part of the artwork yourselves , and hopefully , one day , I 'll have each and every one of you trapped in one of my jars . Thank you .
