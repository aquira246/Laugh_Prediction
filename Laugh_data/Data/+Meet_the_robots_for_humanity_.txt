Sarge Salman : All the way from Los Altos Hills , California , Mr. Henry Evans . ( Applause ) Henry Evans : Hello . My name is Henry Evans , and until August 29 , 2002 , I was living my version of the American dream . I grew up in a typical American town near St. Louis . My dad was a lawyer . My mom was a homemaker . My six siblings and I were good kids , but caused our fair share of trouble . After high school , I left home to study and learn more about the world . I went to Notre Dame University and graduated with degrees in accounting and German , including spending a year of study in Austria . Later on , I earned an MBA at Stanford . I married my high school sweetheart , Jane . I am lucky to have her . Together , we raised four wonderful children . I worked and studied hard to move up the career ladder , eventually becoming a chief financial officer in Silicon Valley , a job I really enjoyed . My family and I bought our first and only home on December 13 , 2001 , a fixer-upper in a beautiful spot of Los Altos Hills , California , from where I am speaking to you now . We were looking forward to rebuilding it , but eight months after we moved in , I suffered a stroke-like attack caused by a birth defect . Overnight , I became a mute quadriplegic at the ripe old age of 40 . It took me several years , but with the help of an incredibly supportive family , I finally decided life was still worth living . I became fascinated with using technology to help the severely disabled . Head tracking devices sold commercially by the company Madentec convert my tiny head movements into cursor movements , and enable my use of a regular computer . I can surf the web , exchange email with people , and routinely destroy my friend Steve Cousins in online word games . This technology allows me to remain engaged , mentally active , and feel like I am a part of the world . One day , I was lying in bed watching CNN , when I was amazed by Professor Charlie Kemp of the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech demonstrating a PR2 robot . I emailed Charlie and Steve Cousins of Willow Garage , and we formed the Robots for Humanity project . For about two years , Robots for Humanity developed ways for me to use the PR2 as my body surrogate . I shaved myself for the first time in 10 years . From my home in California , I shaved Charlie in Atlanta . ( Laughter ) I handed out Halloween candy . All of us have disabilities in one form or another . Last year , Kaijen Hsiao of Willow Garage connected with me Chad Jenkins . Chad Jenkins : Henry , all joking aside , I bet all of these people here would love to see you fly this drone from your bed in California 3,000 miles away . ( Applause ) Okay , Henry , have you been to D.C. lately ? ( Laughter ) Are you excited to be at TEDxMidAtlantic ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Can you show us how excited you are ? ( Laughter ) All right , big finish . ( Applause ) All right , we still have a little ways to go with that , but I think it shows the promise . What makes Henry 's story amazing is it 's about understanding Henry 's needs , understanding what people in Henry 's situation need from technology , and then also understanding what advanced technology can provide , and then bringing those two things together for use in a wise and responsible way . Back to you , Henry . HE : Thank you , Chad . With this drone setup , we show the potential for bedridden people to once again be able to explore the outside world , and robotics will eventually provide a level playing field where one is only limited by their mental acuity and imagination , where the disabled are able to perform the same activities as everyone else , and perhaps better , and technology will even allow us to provide an outlet for many people who are presently considered vegetables . It is up to us , all of us , to decide how robotics will be used , for good or for evil , for simply replacing people or for making people better , for allowing us to do and enjoy more . Our goal for robotics is to unlock everyone 's mental power by making the world more physically accessible to people such as myself and others like me around the globe . Thank you . ( Applause )
