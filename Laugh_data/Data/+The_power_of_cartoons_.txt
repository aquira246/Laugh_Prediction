So yeah , I 'm a newspaper cartoonist -- political cartoonist . I do n't know if you 've heard about it -- newspapers ? It 's a sort of paper-based reader . ( Laughter ) It 's lighter than an iPad , it 's a bit cheaper . ( Laughter ) Ladies and gentlemen , the world has gotten smaller . ( Laughter ) You know , these last two cartoons -- I did them live during a conference in Hanoi . ( Laughter ) No , but it 's true : the Internet has changed the world . ( Laughter ) Now I should n't get into this . ( Laughter ) In 2006 , a few months after , I went Ivory Coast -- Western Africa . And of course , I went to see the rebels in the north . So back in Abidjan , I was given a chance to lead a workshop with local cartoonists there and I thought , yes , in a context like this , cartoons can really be used as weapons against the other side . So the idea was there . So , preaching for freedom of speech is easy here , but as you have seen in contexts of repression or division , again , what can a cartoonist do ? He has to keep his job . Thank you . ( Applause )
