Today I 'm going to talk about work . And the question I want to ask and answer is this : `` Why do we work ? '' Why do we drag ourselves out of bed every morning instead of living our lives just filled with bouncing from one TED-like adventure to another ? ( Laughter ) You may be asking yourselves that very question . So , we would n't work if we did n't get paid , but that 's not why we do what we do . ( Laughter ) Now , I think this is totally obvious , but the very obviousness of it raises what is for me an incredibly profound question . So the question is , `` Why ? '' And here 's the answer : the answer is technology . ( Laughter ) In addition to creating things , science creates ideas . If you think your poverty is God 's will , you pray . And there 's something special about idea technology , that makes it different from the technology of things . And that 's how the industrial revolution created a factory system in which there was really nothing you could possibly get out of your day 's work , except for the pay at the end of the day . It is not true that you `` just ca n't get good help anymore . The thing about science -- natural science -- is that we can spin fantastic theories about the cosmos , and have complete confidence that the cosmos is completely indifferent to our theories . The distinguished anthropologist , Clifford Geertz , said , years ago , that human beings are the `` unfinished animals . And so you people -- pretty much the closest I ever get to being with masters of the universe -- you people should be asking yourself a question , as you go back home to run your organizations . Thank you . ( Applause ) Thanks .
