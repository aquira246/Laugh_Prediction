Today I 'm going to unpack for you three examples of iconic design , and it makes perfect sense that I should be the one to do it because I have a Bachelor 's degree in Literature . ( Laughter ) But I 'm also a famous minor television personality and an avid collector of Design Within Reach catalogs , so I pretty much know everything there is . Now , I 'm sure you recognize this object ; many of you probably saw it as you were landing your private zeppelins at Los Angeles International Airport over the past couple of days . It was first excavated in 1961 as they were building LAX , although scientists believe that it dates back to the year 2000 Before Common Era , when it was used as a busy transdimensional space port by the ancient astronauts who first colonized this planet and raised our species from savagery by giving us the gift of written language and technology and the gift of revolving restaurants . It is thought to have been a replacement for the older space ports located , of course , at Stonehenge and considered to be quite an improvement due to the uncluttered design , the lack of druids hanging around all the time and obviously , the much better access to parking . ( Applause ) ( Music ) Ah yes , a table . It is a design that challenges your intuition -- it is not what you think it is when you first see it . It is also not a monument to design , it is a monument to design 's utility . Okay , what is this object ? I have no idea . No , I have an iPhone . Every now and then , I admit that I complete a phone call on it occasionally . And unlike the juicy salif , it does not threaten to attach itself to your brain , rather , it simply attaches itself to your brain . ( Applause )
