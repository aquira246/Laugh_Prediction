So , I 've known a lot of fish in my life . I 've loved only two . That first one , it was more like a passionate affair . It was a beautiful fish : flavorful , textured , meaty , a bestseller on the menu . What a fish . ( Laughter ) Even better , it was farm-raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability . I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months . For the past 50 years , we 've been fishing the seas like we clear-cut forests . So here , finally , was a company trying to do it right . `` Don , '' I said , `` just to get the facts straight , you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea , you do n't pollute . `` That 's right , '' he said . 2.5 to one , great . `` Sustainable proteins , '' he said . `` Great , '' I said . So the next day , just before the event , I called Don . He said he did n't know . `` Don , '' I said , `` what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? '' Well , he mentioned some algaes and some fish meals , and then he said chicken pellets . He said , `` Yeah , feathers , skin , bone meal , scraps , dried and processed into feed . I said , `` What percentage of your feed is chicken ? '' Thinking , you know , two percent . `` Well , it 's about 30 percent , '' he said . I said , `` Don , what 's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish ? '' ( Laughter ) There was a long pause on the line , and he said , `` There 's just too much chicken in the world . I fell out of love with this fish . This second fish , it 's a different kind of love story . Who can make a fish taste good after it 's been overcooked ? I ca n't , but this guy can . Until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians . What did they do ? They reversed the flow of water . I was there not long ago with Miguel . It turns out , Miguel spent the better part of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa . He said , `` Fish ? I did n't know anything about fish . And do n't get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biotic community unplugged , kind of thing . He pointed at the algae . `` I know , dude , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships : It 's amazing . Well , he goes on to tell me it 's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they 'd be eating in the wild . Later that day , I was driving around this property with Miguel , and I asked him , I said , `` For a place that seems so natural , unlike like any farm I 'd ever been at , how do you measure success ? '' At that moment , it was as if a film director called for a set change . `` That 's success , '' he said . I said , `` Miguel , are n't they feasting on your fish ? '' ( Laughter ) `` Yes , '' he said . I said , `` Miguel , is n't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm ? '' ( Laughter ) He shook his head , no . He said , `` We farm extensively , not intensively . Okay , so let 's review : a farm that does n't feed its animals , and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators . I was imagining a `` March of the Penguins '' thing , so I looked at Miguel . He looked at me like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song . I did n't mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious -- and I do n't like fish skin ; I do n't like it seared , I do n't like it crispy . OK. A farm that does n't feed its fish , a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators . What we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture , one in which the food actually tastes good . Can I be honest ? I do n't love that question . Feed grain to herbivores , pesticides to monocultures , chemicals to soil , chicken to fish , and all along agribusiness has simply asked , `` If we 're feeding more people more cheaply , how terrible could that be ? '' That 's been the motivation , it 's been the justification : it 's been the business plan of American agriculture . Our breadbasket is threatened today , not because of diminishing supply , but because of diminishing resources . Want to feed the world ? Let 's start by asking : How are we going to feed ourselves ? Or better : How can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself ? ( Applause ) To do that , do n't look at the agribusiness model for the future . Look to Miguel , farmers like Miguel . Thank you .
