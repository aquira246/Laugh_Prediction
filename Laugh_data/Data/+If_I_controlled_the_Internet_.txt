I wrote this poem after hearing a pretty well known actress tell a very well known interviewer on television , `` I 'm really getting into the Internet lately . I just wish it were more organized . '' So ... ( Laughter ) If I controlled the Internet , you could auction your broken heart on eBay . ( Laughter ) If I were in charge of the Internet , you could Mapquest your lover 's mood swings . ( Laughter ) Heck , if I ran the Web , you could email dead people . ( Laughter ) They would not email you back ( Laughter ) -- but you 'd get an automated reply . ( Laughter ) Their name in your inbox ( Laughter ) -- it 's all you wanted anyway . ( Laughter ) Listen , you 'll see being dead is dandy . ( Laughter ) Grandma.com would be a recipe for biscuits and spit-bath instructions . ( Laughter ) Huh ? Maybe Google would hire this . ( Applause )
