`` My Air Jordans cost a hundred with tax . My suede Starters jacket says Raiders on the back . I 'm stylin ' , smilin ' , lookin ' real mean , because it ai n't about being heard , just being seen . My leather Adidas baseball cap matches my fake Gucci backpack . ( Laughter ) Ai n't nobody who looks as good as me , but this costs money , it sure ai n't free , and I gots no job , no money at all , but it 's easy to steal all this from the mall . Thank you . For the last 15 years that I have been performing , all I ever wanted to do was transcend poetry to the world . And in 1996 , I found the answer in principles in a master spoken-word artist named Reg E. Gaines , who wrote the famous poem , `` Please Do n't Take My Air Jordans . Now I could have quit . So instead of quitting , I followed him everywhere . Then one day I told him , `` Reg E. , what is subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration ? '' ( Laughter ) And he handed me a black-and-white printed out thesis on a poet named Etheridge Knight and the oral nature of poetry , and from that point , Reggie stopped becoming the best to me , because what Etheridge Knight taught me was that I could make my words sound like music , even my small ones , the monosyllables , the ifs , ands , buts , whats , the gangsta in my slang could fall right on the ear , and from then on , I started chasing Etheridge Knight . But that was n't the biggest lesson I ever learned . And I said to him , `` Listen , punk fool , you 're a failed actor who became an agent , and you know why you failed as an actor ? Because people like me took your job .
