You will understand nothing with my type of English . It 's good for you because you can have a break after all these fantastic people . I must tell you I am like that , not very comfortable , because usually , in life , I think my job is absolutely useless . I mean , I feel useless . Now after Carolyn , and all the other guys , I feel like shit . And definitively , I do n't know why I am here , but -- you know the nightmare you can have , like you are an impostor , you arrive at the opera , and they push you , `` You must sing ! '' I do n't know . ( Laughter ) So , so , because I have nothing to show , nothing to say , we shall try to speak about something else . Because there is different types of design . After , there is the narcissistic design : it 's a fantastic designer who designs only for other fantastic designers . Me , I have strictly no power to change anything . Voice offstage : Four point five . Yes , point five , OK , OK , OK ! ( Laughter ) I 'm a designer , that 's all , of Christmas gifts . After , we become a fish ; after , we become a frog ; after , we become a monkey ; after , we become what we are today : a super-monkey , and the fun is , the super-monkey we are today , is at half of the story . That is our poetry . And here is something : nobody is obliged to be a genius , but everybody is obliged to participate . That 's why , perhaps , you will try to have this angle of vision . Take care , in this training , to be a good mutant . That 's why every morning , now , because you are a good mutant , you will raise your angle of view . That means , we can imagine -- I do n't say it was fantastic , but in the '80s , there was not too much war , like that , it was -- we can imagine that the civilization can become civilized . That 's why today I 'm so ashamed to make this job . Because we have almost finished , I 'll repeat this story .
