The Earth needs no introduction . It needs no introduction in part because the Apollo 17 astronauts , when they were hurtling around the moon in 1972 , took this iconic image . It galvanized a whole generation of human beings to realize that we 're on Spaceship Earth , fragile and finite as it is , and that we need to take care of it . But while this picture is beautiful , it 's static , and the Earth is constantly changing . It 's changing on days ' time scales with human activity . And the satellite imagery we have of it today is old . Typically , years old . And that 's important because you ca n't fix what you ca n't see . What we 'd ideally want is images of the whole planet every day . So , what 's standing in our way ? What 's the problem ? This is the problem : Satellites are big , expensive and they 're slow . This one weighs three tons . It 's six meters tall , four meters wide . It took up the entire fairing of a rocket just to launch it . One satellite , one rocket . It cost 855 million dollars . Satellites like these have done an amazing job at helping us to understand our planet . But if we want to understand it much more regularly , we need lots of satellites , and this model is n't scalable . So me and my friends , we started Planet Labs to make satellites ultra-compact and small and highly capable . I 'm going to show you what our satellite looks like : This is our satellite . This is not a scale model , this is the real size . It 's 10 by 10 by 30 centimeters , it weighs four kilograms , and we 've stuffed the latest and greatest electronics and sensor systems into this little package so that even though this is really small , this can take pictures 10 times the resolution of the big satellite here , even though it weighs one thousandth of the mass . And we call this satellite `` Dove '' â€” Thank you . ( Applause ) We call this satellite `` Dove , '' and we call it `` Dove '' because satellites are typically named after birds , but normally birds of prey : like Eagle , Hawk , Swoop , Kill , I do n't know , Kestrel , these sort of things . But ours have a humanitarian mission , so we wanted to call them Doves . And we have n't just built them , though . We 've launched them . And not just one , but many . It all started in our garage . Yes , we built our first satellite prototype in our garage . Now , this is pretty normal for a Silicon Valley company that we are , but we believe it 's the first time for a space company . And that 's not the only trick we learned from Silicon Valley . We rapidly prototype our satellites . We use `` release early , release often '' on our software . And we take a different risk approach . We take them outside and test them . We even put satellites in space just to test the satellites , and we 've learned to manufacture our satellites at scale . We 've used modern production techniques so we can build large numbers of them , I think for the first time . We call it agile aerospace , and that 's what 's enabled us to put so much capability into this little box . Now , what has bonded our team over the years is the idea of democratizing access to satellite information . In fact , the founders of our company , Chris , Robbie and I , we met over 15 years ago at the United Nations when they were hosting a conference about exactly that question : How do you use satellites to help humanity ? How do you use satellites to help people in developing countries or with climate change ? And this is what has bonded us . Our entire team is passionate about using satellites to help humanity . You could say we 're space geeks , but not only do we care about what 's up there , we care about what 's down here , too . I 'm going to show you a video from just four weeks ago of two of our satellites being launched from the International Space Station . This is not an animation , this is a video taken by the astronaut looking out of the window . It gives you a bit of a sense of scale of our two satellites . It 's like some of the smallest satellites ever are being launched from the biggest satellite ever . And right at the end , the solar array glints in the sun . It 's really cool . Wait for it . Boom ! Yeah . It 's the money shot . ( Laughter ) So we did n't just launch two of them like this , we launched 28 of them . Water as well . Thank you . We 'll be able to see the extent of all water bodies around the whole world every day and help water security . Which brings me back to this . Thank you very much . ( Applause )
