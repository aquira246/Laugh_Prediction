I grew up with my identical twin , who was an incredibly loving brother . Now , one thing about being a twin is that it makes you an expert at spotting favoritism . If his cookie was even slightly bigger than my cookie , I had questions . And clearly , I was n't starving . ( Laughter ) When I became a psychologist , I began to notice favoritism of a different kind , and that is how much more we value the body than we do the mind . I recently was at a friend 's house , and their five-year-old was getting ready for bed . We sustain psychological injuries even more often than we do physical ones , injuries like failure or rejection or loneliness . Speaking of which , my brother is also a psychologist . Loneliness creates a deep psychological wound , one that distorts our perceptions and scrambles our thinking . Failure does that as well . Are you aware of how your mind reacts to failure ? You need to be . Once we become convinced of something , it 's very difficult to change our mind . Our mind is hard to change once we become convinced . But we do that with psychological injuries all the time . The problem is the urge to ruminate can feel really strong and really important , so it 's a difficult habit to stop . By taking action when you 're lonely , by changing your responses to failure , by protecting your self-esteem , by battling negative thinking , you wo n't just heal your psychological wounds , you will build emotional resilience , you will thrive . Can you imagine what the world would be like if everyone was psychologically healthier ? If there were less loneliness and less depression ? If people knew how to overcome failure ? If they felt better about themselves and more empowered ? If they were happier and more fulfilled ? I can , because that 's the world I want to live in , and that 's the world my brother wants to live in as well . Thank you very much . ( Applause )
