What I want to do this afternoon is something a little different than what 's scheduled . Foreign policy , you can figure that out by watching , I do n't know , Rachel Maddow or somebody , but — ( Laughter ) — I want to talk about young people and structure , young people and structure . Now I had this picture taken , and it was put up on my Facebook page last week , and somebody wrote in , `` Huh , why does he have him standing at attention like that ? '' And then they said , `` But he looks good . He does look good , because kids need structure , and the trick I play in all of my school appearances is that when I get through with my little homily to the kids , I then invite them to ask questions , and when they raise their hands , I say , `` Come up , '' and I make them come up and stand in front of me . When I get six- and seven-year-olds in a group , I have to figure out how to keep them quiet . I say , `` Now listen . `` Uh-huh , uh-huh , uh-huh . `` Huh ! '' ( Laughter ) `` Yes , General . Try it with your kids . But anyway , it 's a game I play , and it comes obviously from my military experience . `` You did n't shave . `` No , do n't tell me how often you scraped your face this morning . `` No excuse , sir . But you 'd be amazed at what you can do with them once you put them in that structure . I spend a lot of time with youth groups , and I say to people , `` When does the education process begin ? '' We 're always talking about , `` Let 's fix the schools . That is n't the whole answer . When does the learning process begin ? Does it begin in first grade ? No , no , it begins the first time a child in a mother 's arms looks up at the mother and says , `` Oh , this must be my mother . And that 's what you have to do to prepare children for education and for school . The last chapter in my book is called `` The Gift of a Good Start . I was privileged to have that kind of good start . Now the authorities at CCNY were getting tired of me being there . But it begins with the gift of a good start . My gift of a good start was not only being in a nice family , a good family , but having a family that said to me , `` Now listen , we came to this country in banana boats in 1920 and 1924 . They had expectations for all of the cousins and the extended family of immigrants that lived in the South Bronx , but they had more than just expectations for us . And I also had this extended network . `` Do n't give us any of that self-actualization stuff . And so , it 's so essential that we kind of put this culture back into our families , all families . We 're going to be a minority-majority country in one more generation . But now I 'm alone . I did it just last week . You 're , well , you 're General Powell . `` Yes , yes . I hand him the money . `` No , General . I accept the generosity , continue up the street , and it washes over me , my God , it 's the same country that greeted my parents this way 90 years ago . So we are still that magnificent country , but we are fueled by young people coming up from every land in the world , and it is our obligation as contributing citizens to this wonderful country of ours to make sure that no child gets left behind . Thank you very much . ( Applause )
