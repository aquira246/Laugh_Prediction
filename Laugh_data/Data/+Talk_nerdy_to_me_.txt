Five years ago , I experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be Alice in Wonderland . Penn State asked me , a communications teacher , to teach a communications class for engineering students . And I was scared . ( Laughter ) Really scared . We desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world . I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging . And when you 're describing your science , beware of jargon . So I think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland that is science and engineering .
