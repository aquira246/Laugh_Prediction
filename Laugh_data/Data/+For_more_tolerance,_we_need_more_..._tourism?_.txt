I 'm a tourism entrepreneur and a peacebuilder , but this is not how I started . When I was seven years old , I remember watching television and seeing people throwing rocks , and thinking , this must be a fun thing to do . So I got out to the street and threw rocks , not realizing I was supposed to throw rocks at Israeli cars . Instead , I ended up stoning my neighbors ' cars . ( Laughter ) They were not enthusiastic about my patriotism . This is my picture with my brother . I was angry , I was bitter , and all I wanted was revenge . But that changed when I was 18 . I do so through many ways . In 2009 , I cofounded Mejdi Tours , a social enterprise that aims to connect people , with two Jewish friends , by the way , and what we 'll do , the model we did , for example , in Jerusalem , we would have two tour guides , one Israeli and one Palestinian , guiding the trips together , telling history and narrative and archaeology and conflict from totally different perspectives . Imagine with me if the one billion people who travel internationally every year travel like this , not being taken in the bus from one side to another , from one hotel to another , taking pictures from the windows of their buses of people and cultures , but actually connecting with people . You know , I remember having a Muslim group from the U.K. going to the house of an Orthodox Jewish family , and having their first Friday night dinners , that Sabbath dinner , and eating together hamin , which is a Jewish food , a stew , just having the connection of realizing , after a while , that a hundred years ago , their families came out of the same place in Northern Africa . Thank you . ( Applause )
