Although many of you already know that I do speak the Queen's English because I am from Queens, New York.


So feel free to think of this as Sarah University.


Okay.


But anyway.


Isn't that adorable?


But even so, a wonderful talent.


Anyway.


So --  

I just -- I'm sorry.


Thank you very much.


And we were only 11 years old, so it was not appropriate.


And usually my work, it takes me to Washington D.C. And there, I must attend these meetings, mingling with some tiresome politicians, trying to make me feel comfortable by telling how often they are eating the curry in Georgetown.


But then, I decided, just like Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, I try anyway.


But she told me, "Mom, you don't have to worry about boys because I don't like them."


So, I always teach my kids to respect American ideas, but I told my daughter that this is one exception --  -- that she is not gay, she is just confused by this American problem.


She said she is in love -- in love with a nice Chinese girl.


 So, these are the words I am waiting to hear, but from my son, not my daughter.
